# Project #2: Full Stack Application

## Overview:

It's time to put everything you've learned about Node.js into practice! You'll build a full-stack application using NodeJS, HTML, CSS, JS and NoSQL..

You will be working in groups for this project.

---

## What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in, and reviewed, many of the big themes of the course so far:

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with objects, constructors, events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- **Web Fundamentals**: Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style, and animate documents within a browser. Also learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- **Browser Applications**: Dive into CSS, and figure out how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style and functionality for free.
- **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Making web applications that respond to device size.
- **Server Side Applications**: Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website.
- **Databases**: A permanent set of data held in a computer program, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
- **NoSQL**: "NoSQL" database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data, an alternative to traditional relational databases in which data is placed in tables. Data schema is carefully designed before the database is built.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript programming fundamentals including Object Oriented Programming with Classes and Inheritance.
- **NodeJS and Express**: A web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
- **Mongodb**: A cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema.
- **Mongoose**: Provides a schema-based solution for object modeling with Node.js to model your Mongodb data.
